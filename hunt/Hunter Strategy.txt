TARIEL AI STRATEGY

Utilise messages: “_______”

 - player letter embedded in random string of stuff
 - whereCanTheyGo(hit_player)
 	- Hit_player should continue with randomly moving strategy
	- First other Hunter AI should take whereCanTheyGo[2] (unless it does not exist - 	if next is NULL, counter does not increment). Use shortestPath to move towards 		this location, until destination is reached.
	- Repeat for third Hunter AI but with whereCanTheyGo[3].
	- PLAYER_SEDWARD should continue in his cycle.


e.g. If Harker was hit at Belgrade
“HTariel is amazing wooooooooooooooooBL”
